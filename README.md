# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a credit dataset aimed at understanding customer characteristics and identifying factors that may influence credit risk.

The main goal is to analyze patterns in borrower behavior, financial indicators, and demographic variables to uncover insights that could support credit scoring or risk modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze distribution of key financial variables
- Identify relationships between features
- Detect potential risk patterns
- Generate business-oriented insights

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes anonymized customer information such as:

- Demographic characteristics
- Income and employment details
- Credit history indicators
- Loan attributes
- Target variable (credit risk / default status)

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis includes:

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Missing value analysis
- Data type validation
- Outlier detection

### 2️⃣ Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of income
- Loan amount distribution
- Age segmentation
- Credit history characteristics

### 3️⃣ Bivariate Analysis
- Relationship between income and loan amount
- Default rate by demographic segments
- Correlation heatmap

### 4️⃣ Risk Insights
- High-risk borrower segments
- Financial behavior patterns
- Early signals of potential default

## 📊 Key Insights

- Borrowers with lower income show higher default probability.
- Certain employment categories demonstrate elevated risk.
- Loan-to-income ratio is a strong potential risk indicator.
- Younger age groups tend to have more volatile repayment behavior.
